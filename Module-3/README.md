# Module 3 - Data analysis and machine learning
This module is about learning standard analysis techniques and how to apply state-of-the-art machine learning with Python.

The final project consists of applying two machine learning algorithm to a dataset. Since the dataset is too big to upload, it can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer). The m3_project_extract.py file is a short commented extract of the whole analysis. The code connects to the sqllite database and extracts a part of the data. The whole project will be uploaded soon.
