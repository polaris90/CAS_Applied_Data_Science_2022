# Module 2 - Statistical inference for data science
This module is about becoming familiar with typical statistic concepts for describing and analysing data. 
In addition, this module treats the importance of statistical inference for data science and where to apply it, along with the 
understanding and application of the theoretical concepts as well as how to draw scientific conclusions from statistical analysis results.

The goal of the final project was to create a statistical analysis. The corresponding analysis has been done with bike rental data found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bike-sharing-demand/data). The analysis consists of a descriptive analysis and hypothesis testing. The file Bike_Rental.ipynb consists of the analysis which has been done with the data in the file day.csv. The file CAS_ADS_Modul2_BikeRentalAnalysis_20220922.pptx is a presentation that summarizes all the conlcusions from the analysis.
